## Introduction

This project creates a ROS-based system to control a robot within a Gazebo simulation. It highlights the use of Action Clients and Service Nodes to dynamically set and retrieve target coordinates. The simulation allows user interaction and demonstrates how nodes communicate via ROS.

The repository contains a ROS package with the following components:
 - **Action Client Node**: Manages target setting and communicates with the action server.
 - **Service Node**: Offers a service to retrieve the most recent target coordinates.
 - **Launch File**: Initiates all the nodes.
